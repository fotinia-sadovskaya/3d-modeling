        Hello! My name is Svitlana Voron'ko.<br />
        I am a <strong>3D Generalist</strong> and graduated from the STEP
        Academy in Computer Graphics and IT Design. I want to create games and
        be part of a team of professionals who are passionate about their work.
        <br /><br />
        My main focus is creating and animating 3D surface models and 3D
        characters. I really enjoy modeling, creating objects and characters. I
        always liked to study, to learn something new.I like to apply
        non-standard design solutions. Easy, fast and fun to learn new programs
        and gain new skills. <em>I also love coding</em>
